# SlideshowWallpaper
A live wallpaper that displays images in the Pictures/Wallpapers folder on the internal storage, with a nice fade transition when going between them. It also responds to scrolling on your home screen.

# Usage
Select the live wallpaper from the list. The first time you launch it, it will probably crash, because it needs permissions to read the internal storage. Click the app info button in the crash dialog, and from there, grant the permission to read internal storage.
